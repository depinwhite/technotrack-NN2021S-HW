# technotrack-NN2021S-HW
Here I have published the homework I did in the [Neural Networks course](https://github.com/mailcourses/technotrack-NN2021S-lectures) in spring 2021.

| Title         | Topic                                                                  | 
| ------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------:| 
| HW1           | Gradient descent with your own hands (Linear Regression) from scratch  | 
| HW2           | Multilayer perceptron with your own hands (Neural Network from scratch |  
| HW3           | Multilayer perceptron on PyTorch                                       |   
| HW6           | Autoencoders for identifying anomalies                                 |
